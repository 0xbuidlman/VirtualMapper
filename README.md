## Instructions

To use:

### 1.Export the screen model

This app loads first polygon as screen, others as guide objects(stage, interior and so on) automatically.
So you have to add your project some ajustments showing below.

* In your 3DCG application, merge screen models into one object and bring it top of Object Tree.
* Check if the model has UV coords.
* Export as a file being supported by [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp). (I recommend .obj)
