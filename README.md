## Instructions

You have to prepare a 3D screen model and a net image of screen.

To use:

### Export the screen model

* Merge screen models into one object in your 3DCG application.
* Check if the model has UV coords.
* Export as a file being supported by [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp). (I recommend .obj)

### Setup an application publishing net image via Syphon

For Example:

* After Effects: using [AESyphon plugin](http://tobiasebsen.dk/experiments/aesyphon/).
* VDMX: refer to this page [Syphon Output - VDMX](http://vdmx.vidvox.net/tutorials/syphon-output)

You have to keep this application opened while using VirtualMapper.

### Open VirtualMapper

* In control panel, choose an application from drop down menu under the [Source].
* Click [select 3d file..] and select 3d model on file dialogue.

Notes: if it do not work properly, try restarting the application.

### Additional Usage

I am going to publish tutorial on [my vimeo](http://vimeo.com/baku89) in a few days.
